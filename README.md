# ConvertToDicom

This is a program (OS X 10.7 or later) which reads in a series of images and converts them to DICOM format.
Not all input image formats have been tested but any format supported by ITK (http://www.itk.org) should work.

This is a Qt - and therefore portable - implementation of an earlier program (ConvertToDicom) which is
an OSX only project.
