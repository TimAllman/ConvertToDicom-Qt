# ConvertToDicom

This is a program which reads in a series of images and converts them to DICOM format.
Not all input image formats have been tested but any format supported by ITK (http://www.itk.org) should work.

This is a program built with Qt which will run on Linux(X11), MacOS and Windows(7+).
