How to make sure that files are read
------------------------------------

1) before the DicomAttributes dialog is shown and

2) as soon as possible so that reading errors can be detected.

So, read series

1) When input directory line edit loses focus (except to the Choose button), it must always have the first focus.
2) When input directory dialog closes.
3) When the Convert button is clicked.

Ensure that a series is read only once so that its parameters are not reset.

**********************************************************************************************

Process for converting files (assuming one series only is in the directory)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Read the series. If successful, flag series (ie directory name) as loaded. Otherwise show error dialog.

2) Extract available parameters. This may be minimal if all we have is what is stored in the ImageIOBase
descendant instance. If DICOM, get everything we want for the dialog. Otherwise use the saved defaults.

3) If output directory does not exist, make it.

4) If 3) is successful, use DicomSeriesWriter to create the new files.
